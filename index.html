				<h2>1</h2>
				<h3>Useful Is Forever</h3>
				<p>
					Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>2</h2>
				<h3>Great Service Is Everything</h3>
				<p>
					We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>3</h2>
				<h3>Clarity Is King</h3>
				<p>
					Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>4</h2>
				<h3>Our Customers Are Our Investors</h3>
				<p>
					Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="columntwo">
			<div>
				<h2>5</h2>
				<h3>The Basics Are Beautiful</h3>
				<p>
					We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>6</h2>
				<h3>No Hidden Fees or Secret Prices</h3>
				<p>
					We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>7</h2>
				<h3>Software Should Be Easy</h3>
				<p>
					Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>8</h2>
				<h3>Long-Term Contracts Are Obscene</h3>
				<p>
					No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
